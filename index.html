		<p> Red Velvet Life is a page dedicated to some of the things I enjoy most in life, including: 
			<ul> 
			Specialized Volunteering/Community Involvement 
			Efficient planning and organizing
			Reading, especially Russian Literature
			Crafting (always an adventure, as this is not a particular strong suit of mine)
			Cooking and Baking (also an adventure) 
			Playwriting
			Trying new things! </ul> <br> <br> 

		This page website is currently development, but I'm excited to write about the things I enjoy and try out.
